# LocalContestEmulator
A project of Local Contest Emulator that allows employees within a company to play virtual games together.
It uses a model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern (skinny controller, skinny model) and a service layer with single responsibility 
where all the business logic is put in separate classes. These architectural choices allow for smart unit test coverage and clean code.
